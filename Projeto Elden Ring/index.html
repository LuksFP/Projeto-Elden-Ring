                 <div id="txt1"> <p>Margit is the first trial by fire for Elden Ring players and the first boss that triggers an achievement, in fact. In fact, perhaps it's because she appears so early in the game that Margit is so complicated. He guards the entrance to Stormveil, Godrick's castle. Fallen Omen is difficult because it imposes painful attacks, but with great range.

                  In addition to having a large area of ​​impact, Margit still does not have an attack pattern that is so simple to define to impose dodges. Sometimes he attacks quickly, sometimes he raises his big weapon and holds it until the last moment to cut down the opponent. Explore the area enough to reach Margit at a good level and not get hit so much, but suffering is inherent with him.</p>

<ul><li>

<p>1.Purchase Margit's Shackle from Patches in Murkwater Cave
There's an item you can procure ahead of time which is specially designed to make the fight against Margit a bit easier. Head to Murkwater Cave - a small cave off the river leading up from Limgrave's main bridge. Fight the boss, Patches, until he surrenders. Don't kill him. Next time you return to Murkwater Cave, he'll have a shop open where you can purchase Margit's Shackle for 5,000 runes.

Margit's Shackle can be used up to twice in the Margit fight, but only during Margit's first phase (before he whips out his Holy Hammer at around half-health). After that, the item has no effect. When activated, it will cause Margit to topple to the ground and stay there for several seconds, allowing you to safely dish out at least a full combo of attacks on him. Make sure you use it twice early on before its usefulness runs dry.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p3>2. Enlist the aid of Sorcerer Rogier and your Spirit Ashes
Just before you pass through the mist to fight Margit, look to the right and you'll see a golden rune on the floor. Whenever you see this, it's an indication that you can summon an NPC ally to help you in the coming battle. In this case, you can summon Sorcerer Rogier - a magic-wielder who doesn't deal much damage, but will happily tank some of Margit's attacks so you can engage him more safely.

You should also make use of your strongest Spirit Ashes in the fight, to divide Margit's attention. Lone Wolves are a decent summon here. They won't last too long against Margit's wide sweeping attacks, but every little helps.</p3></li></ul>
<ul><li><p4>3. Use Heavy Attacks to break Margit's Super-Armour
Margit may be tough, but he can be staggered without too much trouble. Utilise the openings you've created by using Margit's Shackle and adding more targets to divide Margit's attention. Whenever he is attacking someone else or struggling to recover, hit him with Heavy Attacks to break through his Super Armour. Deal enough damage and you'll stagger him, giving you an opportunity to deal a Critical Hit for bonus damage.</p4></li></ul>

<ul><li><p5>4. Roll into his short combos, roll away from his long combos
    I'd advise against blocking Margit's attacks, because his long-reaching and long-lasting combos will quickly stagger and kill you. If you're comfortable parrying, then more power to you: but if you're not, I'd strongly recommend dodge-rolling a lot during this fight.

Once you start to recognise Margit's attack patterns, try to roll away from his long combos ahead of time, to keep yourself out of his impressive range. But for shorter combos with just one or two attacks, roll into him instead. If you're a melee character, you should try to stay close to him, to prevent him from using his ranged attacks, and to capitalise on his staggered states.
</p5></li></ul>
<ul><li><p6>5. Stay away from the arena edges
    The edges of the arena are open, sheer drops, and it's very easy for one of Margit's attacks to push you off the edge, resulting in an instant death. Try to stay away from the edges, and never put yourself between Margit and a nearby edge.
    
    Oh, and in case you were wondering - you can't push Margit off the edge. No easy way out of this fight, I'm afraid.</p6></li></ul>

         <div id="txt2">  Godrick the Grafted, also known as Godrick the Golden, is a Demigod Boss in Elden Ring. This Elden Ring Godrick the Grafted Guide features boss locations, tips, strategies and videos on how to defeat Godrick easily, as well as boss stats and lore for Godrick. Bosses are unique and challenging Enemies that can be encountered all over the Lands Between. Shardbearers drop their own unique Great Rune and Remembrance capable of being transformed into powerful Weapons, Spells, Ashes of War, and Talismans for the player.

           Godrick the Grafted is the ruler of Stormveil Castle, and is one of the first demigods and shardbearers that players can fight. He is a descendant of Godfrey and thus born of the golden lineage, but Gideon and Kenneth Haight believe him to be weak and unworthy to rule. Much of Godrick's power comes from the arms and legs of soldiers he's grafted onto himself, and especially the dragon head grafted onto his left arm during the second phase of his fight. His knights and soldiers wear armor that bears emblems of the golden lineage: a two-headed war-axe and the beast regent, Serosh.
           
           Godrick is an optional boss, and doesn't need to be defeated in order to advance in Elden Ring. You can advance to Liurnia of the Lakes without defeating him by following the path north from Stormhill Shack, then dropping down to the west from the broken bridge and walking along the outside of the castle. However, Godrick is a shardbearer, and two of the four available shardbearers must be defeated before entering Leyndell, Royal Capital.</p7><br><br></div>

           <ul><li><p9>1. Split Godrick's attention by summoning Nepheli Loux
               On the approach to Godrick's arena, just past the barricades guarded by Warhawks there is a doorway on the right. There you'll meet the warrior, Nepheli Loux. Exhaust her dialogue, and she'll pledge to fight Godrick with you.
               
               After this, you can summon Nepheli just outside the mist wall to Godrick's lair. She is likely to be a more powerful ally than any Spirit Ashes you can summon at this stage of the game, and while she won't deal a tremendous amount of damage to Godrick, she'll divide his attention, leaving you open to backstab him.</p9></li></ul>
               <ul> <li><p10>2. Godrick's laugh means you should keep your distance
                   One of Godrick's most dangerous attacks is a ground slam. A second or so after the slam itself lands, another, even more powerful and wider-ranging shockwave will emanate from Godrick's position. The best thing to do when he does this move is simply to keep your distance. Luckily, during Godrick's first phase he will preface this attack with a laugh, so keep an ear out for that.
           
                   In the second phase, this attack evolves: instead of a laugh it's a more subtle grunt, and there will be three slams instead of two. The third is delayed by an extra couple of seconds, so be wary. Again, keep your distance while this is going on.</p10></li></ul>
                   <ul> <li> <p11>3. Attack from behind during Godrick's phase transition
                       Deal enough damage to Godrick and it will prompt his second phase, and you'll watch a brief cutscene where he slices off his own arm and grafts on a dragon's head as a replacement. However, there's a brief amount of time between staggering Godrick and the cutscene beginning, where Godrick will start screaming. Stay to his sides or behind him to avoid his self-attack, but keep hacking away at him during these precious few seconds, because it's one of the only opportunities to safely deal damage in the entire fight.</p11></li></ul>
                       <ul><li><p12>4. Watch out for the dragon bite attack
                           Probably the most devastating of Godrick's attacks is the dragon bite in his second stage, where he scoops you up into his dragon's mouth and burns you. This is likely to be a one-hit-kill if you're caught.
                           
                           Hopefully he will direct this attack at Nepheli rather than you, but you should be prepared for the attack. It doesn't have much of a windup, but a half-second before the attack, you'll hear the dragon start to roar. This is your cue to dodge.</p12></li></ul>
                          <ul><li> <p13>5. Don't get greedy: keep your distance during the flame attacks
                               During Godrick's second phase, he just loves to use his newly grafted dragon head arm as a flamethrower. Your best bet is to utilise the terrain elevation, and to keep your distance as much as possible. He'll always begin his second phase with one of these attacks; run backwards at the start in an attempt to bring Nepheli out of danger.
           
           You'll also notice one or two moments in the above video where I could have attacked while Godrick was occupied roasting Nepheli, but I instead chose to keep my distance. The fire attacks can be quite unpredictable, sometimes glitching through uneven terrain and hitting you unexpectedly. So I found it's best to simply play it patient and keep your distance whenever the dragon is doing its work.

                <div id="Rennalavideo"><figure><video width="800" poster="./pics2]/rennala.png" controls autoplay><source src="./videos/SaveTube.io-Elden Ring - Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon Cutscene.mp4"></video></figure></div>
                <div id="txt3"><p14>As a young astrologer who gazed at the night sky and always chased the stars, Rennala would encounter an enchanting full moon that would one day bewitch the Academy of Raya Lucaria.

                    In her youth, she was a prominent champion who charmed the academy with her lunar magic, becoming its master. She established the house of Caria as royalty, and also led the Glintstone Knights. These Carian Knights were heroes of the highest honors, anointed by the Lunar Queen, and despite numbering fewer then twenty, their power made them a match for even the champions of gold in battle.
                    
                    When Queen Marika the Eternal established her new Age of the Erdtree, she dispatched a champion known as Radagon to lead her armies against Liurnia of the Lakes. Radagon fought two wars against Rennala and the Academy, both of which saw no clear victor. Instead, Radagon repented his territorial aggressions by cleansing himself with Celestial Dew, and swore his love to Rennala. They married at the Church of Vows, uniting the houses of the Erdtree and the Moon.Rennala would gift Radagon with a greatsword, bestowed by a Carian queen upon her spouse to honor long-standing tradition.
                    
                    Together, they had three children: Radahn, Rykard, and Ranni.After Godfrey, the first Elden Lord, was hounded from the Lands Between, Radagon left Rennala's side to become the second husband and King Consort of Queen Marika, and received the title of second Elden Lord.
                     Queen Marika made Radagon's and Rennala's children her demigod stepchildren.When Radagon departed, he gifted Rennala the amber egg containing the Great Rune of the Unborn.
                    
                    When Radagon left, Rennala's heart left with him.[16] Realizing their heartbroken queen was no champion at all, the Academy rebelled against the Carian Royal Family and Rennala would find herself under the assault of her own students, who would eventually lock her away in the grand library.She would slowly lose her mind and ended up devoting herself to the grim art of reincarnation, clutching the amber egg left to her by Radagon. She would use it on Juvenile Scholars found around her, calling them her "sweetings", continuously rebirthing them in an imperfect process which would leave their memories fading into oblivion.The children born anew by Rennala were all frail and short-lived, imperfect beings, each and all.
                    
                    The Tarnished gains entry to the Academy of Raya Lucaria in search of the Great Rune contained within Rennala's amber egg. After fighting their way through the Academy, they encounter Rennala in the grand library, hovering in the air and clutching her egg. The tarnished fights their way through the Juvenile Scholars, halting the protective spell cast on the queen by their song. Before they can kill the Carian Queen, however, they are interrupted by the voice of Ranni, and an image of Rennala as she was long ago appears before them. The Tarnished does battle with the illusory Rennala in a moonlit sea, eventually defeating her and claiming her Great Rune. Rennala is left alive, sitting in her chair in the middle of the library, still clutching her egg.</p14></div>
                    <div id="hdr"><u><p15><strong>How Defeat Rennala?</strong></u></p15></div>
                    <ul><li><p16>1. Upgrade your magical protection
                        Rennala's attacks are almost exclusively magical, as you'd expect from the highest authority in the Academy of Raya Lucaria. So in this fight it's really important to switch out your usual physical protection armour for your most magically protective garments. You can loot both a Karolos Glintstone Crown and a Raya Lucarian Robe during your travels through the Academy; both have high magic defence and are therefore great for this fight.
                        
                        If you have any spells such as Magic Fortification, or talismans which can protect you against magical damage, then be sure to add those as well. Seriously, you don't need physical protection for this fight.</p16></li></ul>
                        <ul><li><p17>2. How to beat phase 1 quickly
                            The first phase of Rennala's boss fight is amazingly easy once you understand what's going on. Rennala herself stays floating above her minions, and your aim is to find which of the minions is creating the invulnerable barrier around Rennala. You can tell which one it is because:

They have a golden glow about them;
They will throw magical books at you as you approach;
They will be the source of the lullaby you hear, so it will get louder as you approach them.
Hit the golden minion once, and Rennala will transfer the power to another minion for you to find. Once you've hit three golden minions, Rennala will fall to the floor, her shield shattered. This is your chance to deliver massive damage to her, but be sure to step away before she brings her shield back up, or you'll take damage.

Rinse and repeat until Rennala's HP reaches zero. Be aware that after the first stage, Rennala will turn some of her minions into magical gravestones and send them hurtling towards you; but this attack has a very long wind-up time, and you'll often be able to find and attack all three golden minions before she unleashes it. If you can't interrupt the attack in this way, put as much distance and as many obstacles between you and Rennala as possible until the danger has passed.
                        </p17></li></ul>
                       <ul><li> <p18>3. Play as aggressively as possible in phase 2
                            Phase 2 is where Rennala becomes truly dangerous, as the Queen of the Full Moon is now at full strength and has many magical attacks to send your way. However, despite her intimidating spells, she herself has low poise and can be easily interrupted with melee attacks.
                            
                            Therefore, you should endeavour to stay as close to her as possible. Play aggressive, and always look to close the distance with your rolls as you dodge her magical attacks.</p18></li></ul>
                            <ul><li><p19>4. Use Rennala's spinning shield attack as a chance to heal
                                If you do get hit by one of Rennala's attacks, you'll find they're very powerful. You can likely only take one or two of those attacks before you die. But with her array of homing spells, it can be hard to find a moment to heal.
                                
                                I've found a very useful moment to heal is when Rennala spins her staff in front of her, creating a shield against you. This attack seems to happen fairly often if you stick within melee range. It's easy to dodge, and lasts long enough that after you recover from your roll you'll have time to drink a flask to heal up.</p19></li></ul>
                               <ul><li> <p20>5. Ignore her small summons, avoid her big summons
                                    Once Rennala is below 50% health in her second phase, she may begin to summon Spirit Ashes to attack you for a short while. They will begin with small summons such as Lone Wolves; and while dangerous, these wolves can be avoided. Roll through their bite attacks and continue to pummel Rennala. The summons only last a few seconds before disappearing, so you don't need to deal with them.
                                    
                                    However, at low health Rennala will summon a Dragon Spirit to protect her. That's a little bit of a more dangerous prospect than some wolves, so I'd advise you keep your distance until the danger has passed.
                                    
                                    Of course, as you can see from the above video, if you play aggressive and keep interrupting Rennala towards the end of her life, she may not even have time to summon anything!</p20></li></ul><hr>

This is a spectral shade of Godfrey that is encountered in Leyndell, Royal Capital. This is not an optional boss as players must defeat it to advance in Elden Ring.

                                        Godfrey, First Elden Lord is another variant of this boss fight.</p22></div>
                                        <div id="hdggs"><u><p23><strong>How Defeat Godfrey(Golden Shade)</strong></p23></u></div>
                                        <p24>The first time you encounter Godfrey in the Erdtree Sanctuary of Leyndell, he'll manifest as a golden shade of himself that's less powerful than the original (but still tough nonetheless). Godfrey in this form is a large, relatively slow bulk of an enemy, using wide axe swings and short-range AOE attacks, occasionally charging forward or using a ranged attack out of nowhere to try and catch players off-guard. He shouldn't prove too much of a problem in this first encounter, but here's some useful tidbits to carry you through this encounter.

                                            Players for this fight should be at least level 75, ideally higher, and have +13 weapons or up.
                                            In this form, Godfrey is weak to Lightning and Thrusting damage, but heavily resistant to Holy power, which isn't surprising considering he appears to be made out of it. He's also hard to inflict Bleed on, though it can be done. Plan your weapon choices accordingly.
                                            The first thing Godfrey tends to do when you enter is throw his axe at you, then leap forward to get it again. This offers you a very small window to summon Spirits to help, or risk taking two hundred pounds of divine iron to the head. If you're going to summon or cast spells, do it the moment you enter, or after the axe is thrown and Godfrey is retrieving it.
                                            Whenever Godfrey stomps his foot, it creates a short-range earthquake in front of him. Roll to the side as it comes down, not backwards or forwards.
                                            Godfrey's long-range axe sweeps mean that if he's doing melee attacks, your best hope is to roll towards him, under the blade. This also sets you up nicely for follow-up strikes.
                                            Godfrey likes to chain various combos together, causing a certain amount of unpredictability. If you've seen him string a chain of attacks together before, don't expect it to end the same way next time Slay this echo of a great king and you'll be rewarded with 80000 Runes, not to mention a Talisman Pouch, a permanent upgrade to your equipment that allows you to wear another Talisman. It's definitely worth making use of that, as there's some game-changing talismans out there. You'll also want to level up at the new Site of Grace that's appeared, as you're about to go have another boss fight immediately after this.

                                            You won't see Godfrey again for a long time, but he will be back. Read on to discover what he's capable of and how you can defeat him the second time round.

                                            <div id="txt5"><p>Morgott was born of the Golden Lineage,the offspring of the first Elden Lord, Godfrey and Queen Marika, and was the twin brother of Mohg.The twins were both born as accursed Omen,and as a result were confined to the Subterranean Shunning Grounds below the capital.Because they were born of royalty, their horns were not excised.[5] Unlike his brother, Morgott would renounce his accursed blood and seal it away within a blade,which was in turn concealed within a wooden staff he carried.
                                                The Shattering
                                                When Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, Morgott claimed one of the Great Runes. With Leyndell in disarray, Morgott claimed the city for himself and defended it and the Erdtree against his fellow demigods. While he succeeded in securing Leyndell, he found that the Erdtree would not admit him, or anyone else, to claim the title of Elden Lord. Despite the fact that he had been reviled as an accursed fiend by the Golden Order, Morgott swore to protect the Erdtree.
                                                
                                                He assumed the name Margit the Fell Omen during the Shattering, slaughtering champions who approached the Erdtree in the hopes of becoming Elden Lord Under this pseudonym, he also lead the Night's Cavalry, who assisted him in the killing of great warriors, knights and champions. Simultaneously, he ruled Leyndell as the Veiled Monarch.
                                                
                                                After claiming two shards of the Elden Ring, the Tarnished gains entrance to Leyndell and challenges Morgott at the Elden Throne. Denouncing them and all of his demigod siblings as traitors and pillagers emboldened by ambition, he attacks the Tarnished champion. Upon his defeat, Morgott warns the Tarnished that the Erdtree would ward them off as it had done for him, and that none may claim the title of Elden Lord. Later, after setting fire to the Erdtree using the Giant's Forge and releasing the Rune of Death, the same Tarnished encounters Godfrey in the throne room, holding Morgott's body as it fades away.</p</div>
                                          <div id="hdmt"><u><p><strong>How Defeat Morgott?</strong></p></u></div>
                                       <ul><li><p>1. Boost your holy damage negation
                                            Morgott has a lot of attacks that inflict holy damage, so you should boost your holy damage negation for this fight. You can do this by equipping a powerful talisman called the Haligdrake Talisman. You can get the standard variant near the Stranded Graveyard at the start of the game, but you'll also find the Haligdrake Talisman +1 through some illusory walls near the Leyndell Catacombs Site of Grace. Make sure to visit one of these areas before attempting this boss fight.
                                            You can also use the Holyproof Dried Liver consumable, which further boosts your holy damage negation. You'll find this item scattered around the Lands Between as you explore, but you can also craft it using the Missionary's Cookbook (6), located in Volcano Manor.
                                        </p></li></ul>
                                       <ul><li> <p>2. Bring the Lone Wolves spirit ash
                                            To make this boss fight much easier, we recommend using the Lone Wolves spirit ash. As you can see in Ollie's footage above, the wolves will keep Morgott busy with constant attacks and occasionally cause the boss to stagger. This makes him vulnerable for a brief moment, giving you a large window to land some easy hits or a powerful visceral attack. To perform a visceral on Morgott, do a simple light attack from the front while he is staggered.
                                            
                                            Since he is a late-game boss, you'll want to upgrade the wolves for this fight. You can upgrade spirit ashes in exchange for Ghost Gloveworts by advancing Roderika's questline until she appears in the Roundtable Hold.</p></li></ul>
                                           <ul><li> <p>3. Use Margit's Shackle
                                                Before fighting Margit at the start of the game, you can buy Margit's Shackle from the boss in Murkwater Cave. This item instantly staggers Margit, making it incredibly useful. If you still have Margit's Shackle when you arrive at Leyndell, then good news! You can also use Margit's Shackle against Morgott, allowing you to easily stagger him during the first phase.
                                                
                                                When he goes into his second phase, indicated by him dropping to the ground and screaming in pain before unleashing a burst of holy flames, Margit's Shackle will stop working. This happens when he reaches half health, so make sure to use it during the first half of the fight to take advantage of this easy stun opportunity.</p></li></ul>
                                               <ul><li> <p>4. Deal bleed or rot damage
                                                    Bleed and scarlet rot are both highly-praised in Elden Ring, and for good reason. These effects will effortlessly obliterate most bosses, including Morgott. Reduvia and Moonveil, both included in our list of the best weapons in Elden Ring, will inflict the bleed effect quickly, taking huge chunks out of Morgott's health bar. If you'd rather use scarlet rot to slowly chip away at his health, head to the Cathedral of Dragon Communion to get the Rotten Breath incantation.

                                                    While he may seem threatening, Morgott actually has a very low amount of health. This means using bleed is particularly effective here, as the bleed effect deals a huge chunk of damage. This will ruin Morgott and, as shown in Ollie's video above, can prove particularly devastating when paired with a visceral.
                                                    
                                                    If you want to respec your character to fit one of the playstyles above, take a look at our Elden Ring Rivers of Blood build, Dexterity bloodhound build, and Elden Ring Arcane build to find some bleed-focused options. For more on those fancy dragon spells, take a look at our Elden Ring Faith build.</p></li></ul>
                                                   <ul><li> <p>5. Take advantage of chances to punish
                                                        If you're struggling to stagger Morgott, you should still have plenty of chances to punish him during this fight. Many of his attacks will end with a moment of recovery, leaving him vulnerable to attacks. Take advantage of these moments to punish Morgott with a flurry of slashes and swipes, which should allow you to get the upper hand.
                                                        
                                                        If you're unsure of when to go wild with attacks, we suggest waiting until he uses his hammer. When you see Morgott swing the holy hammer, roll to avoid taking damage and then follow up with some free hits. Morgott will take a few moments to relax after this attack, giving you a lovely open window to get some hits in.
                                                        
                                                        Another easy chance to punish Morgott is after his spear leap. When he throws the holy spear, he will usually follow up with a leap towards your character. When he lands, you can hit 3-4 times before needing to back off. You'll get a similar opportunity after Morgott unleashes his holy flames during the phase-change animation. Simply run in once the flames have spawned and land some easy hits.</p> </li></ul><hr>

                                                         At some point, the first Elden Lord, Godfrey, was robbed of grace and hounded from the Lands Between. Rykard's father, Radagon, left Rennala to become Queen Marika's new consort and the second Elden Lord.Rykard and his siblings were thus raised to demigods by their new step-mother, Marika.
                                                         
                                                         Under the Golden Order, Rykard was a ruthless justiciar who commanded a company of inquisitors.His inquisitors persecuted and mercilessly tortured those considered heretics to the Golden Order, such as the Albinaurics. He spent time in the volcanic Mt. Gelmir, where he discovered the ancient magma hexes of a forgotten serpent-worshiping religion native to the region, which he brought back into practical use as new sorceries.Rykard also travelled to a foreign land where he encountered a dancer by the name of Tanith, who he would eventually take as his consort.
                                                         
                                                         Rykard was also known for the construction of the Iron Virgins, automatons which were capable of both battlefield carnage and abducting victims to transport them to the Volcano Manor.
                                                         
                                                         Rykard's budding blasphemous inclinations led him to assist his sister, Ranni, in orchestrating the Night of Black Knives. On the night of the plot, Ranni rewarded Rykard with a slab of rock engraved with the traces of the Rune of Death, which would allow him to challenge the black beast of Destined Death, should the coming trespass one day transpire.</p>

                                                            The fight against the God-Devouring Serpent and Rykard himself is an unusual one, because you're all but required to use a specific weapon to beat them. That weapon can be found on your left as you enter the boss arena for the first time. It is the Serpent-Hunter - a great spear which fires off massive long-range lances of light when used against the Serpent and Rykard.
                                                            
                                                            The Serpent-Hunter is a slow and cumbersome weapon, but it deals an awful lot of damage - particularly if you power up its colossal two-stage Great-Serpent Hunt skill. You can deal thousands of points of damage to both the Serpent and Rykard with just this one combo, so use it liberally throughout the fight.</p></li></ul>  
                                                            <ul><li><p>2. Stay out of range of the God-Devouring Serpent's poison The God-Devouring Serpent phase is actually very straightforward. It has few bite attacks which you can easily dodge, and a shockwave attack, which we'll get to shortly. The only other danger in this phase is the Serpent's poison spit attack, which can really ruin your day if it reaches you.

                                                               Fortunately, the poison doesn't travel terribly far. In fact, if you stay right on the edge of the Serpent-Hunter's range, and back off just a few feet whenever it spits, you'll completely avoid all damage from this otherwise devastating attack.</p> </li></ul>  
                                                              <ul><li><p>3. Use a skill to avoid damage against the Serpent's shockwave attack
                                                                  The Serpent's most annoying attack is the shockwave, triggered when it buries its head deep into the ground before throwing its head back up again, sending a shockwave through the rocks towards you. This attack is very hard to avoid and deals an incredible amount of damage. Fortunately, you can completely negate this powerful attack with the right Ash of War skill.

This also allowed me to get in a couple of quick attacks while the Serpent was recovering. But you could also switch to another weapon quickly and use a skill like Raptor Of The Mist, or Bloodhound's Step, either of which give you some i-frames with which to completely avoid damage.</p></li></ul>
                                                                 <ul><li><p>4. Use the Mimic Tear for a much easier time against Rykard
                                                                     Even after the recent patch nerfing the Mimic Tear's effectiveness, this is one fight where you really want the Mimic Tear on your side. I prefer to wait until I've beaten the Serpent and Rykard himself emerges before summoning the Mimic Tear, so it sticks around for as long as possible to distract and deal damage against the more formidable of the two halves of this mighty opponent.
                                                                     
                                                                     Why is the Mimic Tear so good? Apart from the fact that it draws Rykard's attention away from you, the Mimic Tear is an exact copy of you, including equipment and weapons. That means the Mimic Tear has a Serpent-Hunter Great Spear of its own. Whereas most Spirit Ashes will have a hard time even getting close to Rykard, the Mimic Tear can deal quite a bit of damage while it's alive.
                                                                     
                                                                     Of course, the Mimic Tear is not nearly as effective with the weapon as you are, but every little helps. And even if it deals no damage at all to Rykard, if you back off and let Rykard focus on the Mimic, you'll be safe to unleash a couple of Great-Serpent Hunt attacks on him for massive damage.</p></li></ul> 
                                                                    <ul><li><p>5. Don't get too close to the lava or it'll interrupt your attacks
                                                                        The one thing that tripped me up more than anything else in the fight against Rykard, as you'll see from the video at the start of this guide, is that I occasionally got a bit too close to the lava surrounding him. The lava follows Rykard wherever he goes, so as he moves around, so does the lava. So it's best to steer clear of the lava altogether, because while you're winding up a massive attack, the lava may move and hit you, interrupting your attack and making it all for naught.</p></li></ul><hr>

Because they were born of royalty, their horns were not excised.Unlike his brother Morgott, Mohg would embrace his Omen blood.

The Formless Mother ignited his accursed blood with fire, prompting him to develop powerful bloodflame magic.

The extent of Mohg's involvement in the subsequent wars known as the Shattering is unknown, but he assumed the title of Lord of Blood and began quietly recruiting followers from his lair deep below ground.</div>

Miquella was an Empyrean, with the potential of ascending to godhood, and Mohg hoped to raise Miquella to full godhood so that he might rule at his side as consort and take the role of monarch.

But no matter how much of Miquella's bloody bedchamber Mohg tried to share, he would receive no response from the young empyrean.Mohg managed to largely escape the notice of the Roundtable Hold, who searched for clues as to his whereabouts.

When the Tarnished stumbles upon his chambers, Mohg emerges from the cocoon, holding Miquella's hand and apologizing for leaving him, ready to confront their "guests". Mohg unleashes the full power of his accursed blood, but is unable to overcome the Tarnished, falling at their hands.</p></div>
                                                                          <div id="hdmh"> <u><p>How Defeat Mogh?</p></u></div>
      <ul><li>  <p>1. Use the Purifying Crystal tear to reduce Nihil’s damage
            The best solution to Nihil’s damage is the Purifying Crystal Tear. Mix this into your Flask of Wondrous Physick and drink it to gain a buff that massively reduces the spell’s damage. This won’t nullify Mohg’s healing, but it will save you a couple of healing flask charges. In the difficult second phase, that can be the difference between life and death.

Of course, to use the Purifying Crystal Tear you will first have to find it. The Tear is a reward from the later stages of Bloody Finger Hunter Yura’s quest. You’ll need to meet Yura at the Second Church of Marika on Altus Plateau, and help him defeat Bloody Finger Eleonara. If you aren’t caught up on the quest, you can find the rest of the steps in the Yura section of our complete Elden Ring quest guide.
        </p></li></ul>
      <ul><li>  <p>2. Heal through Nihil
            The more obvious if less efficient solution to Nihil’s damage is to just heal through it. The ability hits pretty hard, but you can heal between the three casts. If you’ve upgraded your Flask of Crimson Tears to +12 by finding all the Sacred Tears, you can make up for most of the lost health with two charges. It's easier to afford those flask charges if you have the max of 14, so track down more Golden Seeds if you aren’t quite there. This is far from an elegant solution, but it gets the job done.</p> </li></ul>  
           <ul><li> <p>3. Use Mohg’s Shackle for free damage
                Mohg’s Shackle is a helpful tool for the fight, and can get you through the first phase quicker. It functions much like Margit’s Shackle, which you may have found during the Patches quest. Activate the Shackle to lock Mohg in place and earn a free crit, securing some safe damage in the first phase. Unfortunately, the Shackle only works when Mohg’s health is nearly full, so they won’t work in the second phase. Still, free damage is free damage.
                
                You can find the Shackles deep in the Subterranean Shunning Grounds. Head down to the bottom of the sewer area to find them under a spewing pipe in the far southeast of the room. You can reach them fastest from the Underground Roadside Site of Grace.</p>  </li></ul>
              <ul><li> <p>4. Unlock your camera
                    Many of Mohg’s attacks leave pools of Bloodflame around the arena that deal damage over time and inflict the Blood Loss status. The direct damage isn’t very high, but if you roll into the flames after taking a hit you will be met with a frustrating death. The Blood Loss build-up is even more problematic, and can easily kill you after a brief misstep.
                    
                    Avoiding this requires a lot of awareness, and that’s easier to maintain if you aren’t always staring straight at Mohg. The locked-on camera view is nice for keeping track of the boss, especially when he begins flying about. However, it also makes it harder to keep tabs on nearby flames. If you find yourself circle-strafing to your death, consider avoiding lock-on to get a more holistic view of the arena.</li></ul> </p><hr>

                       <div id="txt8"> <p>Pre-Shattering
                            Radahn was born the son of Radagon, a champion of the Erdtree, and Queen Rennala, head of both the Carian Royal Family and Academy of Raya Lucaria. He had two siblings, Rykard and Ranni. Radahn inherited his father's flaming red hair, and was fond of its heroic implications. From a young age, he was enamored with the Elden Lord Godfrey. Attempting to emulate his idol, Radahn adorned his armor with lions, the symbol of Godfrey.
                            
                            At some point, the first Elden Lord, Godfrey, was robbed of grace and hounded from the Lands Between. Radahn's father, Radagon, left Rennala to become Queen Marika's new consort and the second Elden Lord.Radahn and his siblings were thus raised to demigod status by their new step-mother, Marika.
                            
                            Radahn grew to a massive size, eventually outgrowing his scrawny but beloved steed, Leonard. Not wanting to abandon his horse, Radahn studied gravitational magic in Sellia under a master who was an Alabaster Lord.
                            
                            Mastering gravitational magic allowed Radahn to manipulate the forces of gravity, and to challenge the very stars themselves. Radahn conquered the stars, saving Sellia in the process, using his vast gravitational powers to 'shatter' the stars and arrest their cycles, earning him the moniker of "Starscourge." During this time, he engraved the gravity crest upon his blades.
                            
                            Radahn's soldiers were known as the Redmanes for the red-maned lion raising a sword in the image of Radahn on their surcoats. The longest serving of the Redmane Knights was Ogha, who studied gravitational techniques alongside Radahn in Sellia. It was popularly said that the Redmanes knew no weakness. At an unknown period in time, Jerren, a guest of the Carian royals, became a guest commander for Radahn's armies, and they swore a mutual oath of honorable death.</div>
                            
                            <div id="txt8_2">The Shattering
                           
                            
                            
                            At some point following the Night of Black Knives, Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, and her offspring acquired the Great Runes. The maddening taint of their newfound strength led to the Shattering, a war between Marika's demigod descendants, each seeking to become the new ruler of the Lands Between.
                            From his stronghold of Redmane Castle in the Caelid Wilds, Radahn led his armies against the forces of the other demigods. By the end of the Shattering, only Radahn and his half-sister Malenia, Blade of Miquella were the mightiest left standing. The two fought to a stalemate in the Battle of Aeonia, which ended when Malenia unleashed her Scarlet Rot.
                            
                            The Scarlet Rot ravaged Caelid, and consumed Radahn from the inside, eating away at his psyche. Following the Battle of Aeonia, Radahn roams the Wailing Dunes as a mindless beast who devours the flesh of friend and foe alike, howling at the sky. Without their commander, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve to not return home, and to serve as a bulwark against the spread of the rot in Caelid using fire.
                            
                            In spite of his madness, Radahn continues to ride his scrawny steed, as well as hold the motions of the stars. The Radahn Festival has been organized by his men in Castle Redmane to celebrate his last battle and his death. It is a gathering of mighty warriors who might finally put the General out of his misery, and claim his Great Rune for themselves. The festival serves as Jerren's way of fulfilling his oath of honorable death to Radahn.
                            
                            Upon the participation of The Tarnished (Protagonist), the festival is a success, and Radahn is freed from his tortured existence. His death causes the stars to resume their cycles, some of which come crashing down upon the Lands Between. One such falling star lands in Limgrave, opening the path to Nokron, Eternal City, and allowing the fate of Ranni the Witch to progress.</p></div>
                            <div id="hdgr"><u><p><strong>How Defeat Goat(Radahn)</strong></p></u></div>
                           <ul><li> <p>1. Switch quickly from on foot to horseback during the run towards Radahn
                                The fight against Starscourge Radahn begins with a long run up to the General while he rains bow attacks down upon you from afar. The single-shot arrows are easy to avoid on foot, but near-impossible to avoid on horseback. By contrast, the rain of arrows is much easier to outrun on horseback than on foot.
                                
                                So when you see either of these attacks coming, switch to the correct form of transportation to give yourself the best chance of avoiding damage. Against such a powerful foe, you really want to avoid taking damage until at least you've engaged him in melee combat.</p></li></ul> 
                              <ul><li> <p>2. Let the summoned allies hold Radahn's attention
                                    As you run towards Radahn, be sure to tap each of the summon signs on the ground in front of you, because each one summons a warrior ally to aid you. Together they can do a fair bit of damage to Radahn, but the main benefit is that Radahn has so many enemies to distract him, so he won't spend all his time targeting you.

This allows you to more easily get close and deal damage. But you should still keep an eye on everything that Radahn is doing, because he is capable of pulling off several spinning attack combos which can hit everything around him. So even if he's targeting someone else, you could still be in the line of fire.
                                </p></li></ul> 
                              <ul><li>  <p>3. Use a weapon that inflicts bleed
                                    To make this fight much easier, you should equip (and upgrade) a weapon which inflicts bleed. I opted for an Uchigatana, as it deals a good amount of damage and has good range, while also inflicting bleed with every strike.
                                    
                                    General Radahn is quite susceptible to bleed, and as you can see from the above video, I used it to deal a huge chunk of damage to his health bar towards the end of the fight, severely reducing the amount of time I had to fight him during his more dangerous second phase.</p></li></ul>
                                  <ul><li>
                                     <p>4. Back off and heal during Radahn's AoE attacks
                                        Radahn is fond both of sweeping sword-strikes and ground-slam attacks which create small gravitational shockwaves in an area around him. Fortunately, these attacks have fairly long wind-ups, and if his attention is focused on one of your summoned allies rather than yourself, you should feel very safe to back off and heal during these moments.</p> </li></ul> 
                                        <ul><li><p>5. Get behind Radahn's legs and use heavy attacks to stagger him
                                            Radahn can be staggered without too much difficulty, particularly with the help of your allies all attacking him at once. You can speed along this process by getting behind his legs where it's safest, and using heavy attacks to take large chunks off his invisible posture meter at a time.
                                            
                                            The trick, of course, is getting that close to Radahn without taking damage. The key is to not be intimidated by him. His attacks look fearsome, but they can be dodged through without too much difficulty. You'll need to back off when he does one of his ground-slam attacks, but otherwise you should try to maintain the offensive by constantly closing the gap between you and dealing heavy attacks to his legs.</p> </li></ul>
                                            <ul><li><p>6. Prepare for Radahn's meteorite phase transition attack
                                                Unless you have the damage output to kill Radahn very quickly, you'll likely find that at a certain point after at least half his health is gone, Radahn will disappear. After a few seconds, he will then crash back into the arena as a giant meteorite with a massive area of effect attack.
                                                
                                                If there are several allies left standing, he almost always aims for them, looking to wipe them out and turn this into a one-on-one fight. Given this, I found it a good idea to distance yourself from your allies as much as possible the moment Radahn disappears. That way, if he goes for them you're not in the line of fire; and if he goes for you, you can use Torrent to get out of the way without accidentally redirecting Radahn towards your allies.</p></li></ul><hr>

                                               <div id="txt9"> <p>Malenia was one of the demigod children of Queen Marika the Eternal and her King Consort Radagon of the Golden Order. She and her twin brother Miquella were both selected as Empyreans, candidates to one day succeed their mother as ruler of the Lands Between. However, as they were born from a single god, the twins were cursed; Miquella suffered from eternal childhood and cannot grow to adulthood while Malenia was afflicted with Rot, a lethal blight that slowly degraded her body and infected anyone close to her. Because of the Rot, she ended up losing her right arm, her right knee, and her left leg. As a result, she is required prosthetic limbs.

                                                    Despite the affliction that wracked her body, Malenia, at some point, encountered a blind swordsman, who then became her mentor. Under his tutelage, Malenia was trained into becoming one of the most skillful and powerful warriors in the Lands Between, and thanks to her training, she never lost a battle. This earned her the loyalty of many, including her Cleanrot Knights, who vowed to fight for her, despite the risk of being inflicted with Rot. Some people also began to worship Malenia, as they see her as a goddess.
                                                    
                                                   
                                                    
                                                    Eventually, a massive war known as the Shattering erupted when the Elden Ring was shattered under mysterious circumstances. As numerous factions vied for power, Malenia (with her army of undefeated Cleanrot Knights) sought to use her martial might to reunify the Lands Between and put an end to the chaos. During that time, she won many victories until she came into conflict with General Radahn, her half-brother, whose own goal was incompatible with Malenia's. An epic battle commenced between the Blade of Miquella and the Red Lion general to see on who is superior.
                                                    
                                                    Ultimately, the battle ended in a stalemate when Malenia unleashed the Scarlet Rot, which ravaged the land of Caelid as well as drive Radahn to a feral state. As a result of unleashing the Scarlet Rot, Malenia was left comatose and she was carried to Miquella's haligtree by one of her surviving Cleanrot Knights, Finlay. There, she awaits the return of her twin brother, who had encased himself in a cocoon in the tree in an attempt to reverse his curse.
                                                    
                                                    However, while Malenia was absent or in a coma, Miquella, before he could even emerge from the haligtree was abducted by Mohg, Lord of Blood. Consequently, as a result of her twin brother's absence, Malenia, while in a deep slumber, accidentally infects the haligtree with Rot.
                                                    
                                                    Elden Ring
                                                    Malenia, like most of the demigods, is an optional boss as the player is not required to defeat her in order to advance through the story. During her battle against the Tarnished, she would perform quick attacks with her katana while at the same time regaining the health she had lost, as each time she lands a hit on the player, she can regenerate her HP, making her one of the hardest bosses in the game. After all of her health is depleted, she would collapse to the ground, supposedly dead. However, she actually succumbed to the Scarlet Rot and was reborn as a goddess. In her second phase, Malenia now has Scarlet Rot-based attacks and most of her regular attacks can now inflict Scarlet Rot. Despite this, she is defeated once again, this time for good. Upon her defeat, she will remark that the Tarnished's strength is extraordinary and the mark of a true lord. With her dying words, Malenia apologized to her missing brother Miquella that she has met her match</p></div>
                                                   <div id="hdm"><u> <p><strong>How Defeat Malenia?(sit and cry)</strong></p></u></div>
                                                    <ul><li><p>1. Avoid Malenia's Waterfowl Dance
                                                        Waterfowl Dance is by far Malenia’s most dangerous attack. When it starts, Melania will leap into the air and hover for a second with her sword at the ready. Unless you are out of range or know exactly what to do next, you’re already dead.

Your first option is to run. Waterfowl Dance covers a lot of ground, but it is entirely possible to get far enough away that Malenia can’t catch you. However, you need to either already have some distance or start running immediately when she jumps. Immediately here really means immediately. If you are in an attack, roll, or heal animation when Waterfowl Dance starts, you don’t have time to run.

That brings us to our next option; rolling through the attack. Yes, this is possible. The trick is to roll straight at Melania, passing under her as she starts swinging. Wait until the moment she lunges to roll under her, and you will avoid the first part of the attack. However, there are two follow-up lunges, and you will need to roll past her during these too. If you try to roll away from or perpendicular to Melania, the secondary slashes will catch you coming out of your roll. The only way out is through.

Finally, it is possible to block Waterfowl Dance. However, outside of potential max-endurance, New Game+ build shenanigans, you won’t be able to do it without the Barricade Shield skill. The attack hits nearly a dozen times and will empty your stamina bar and break your block without Barricade Shield’s extra durability. Malenia’s healing also makes blocking tough to recommend, since she will regain health every time she hits your shield. Still, it is an option to consider if the first two methods are failing you.</p></li></ul>
                                                  <ul><li>  <p>2. Learn how to read Malenia's grab
Malenia’s grab attack isn’t quite as threatening as Waterfowl Dance, but nothing in Elden Ring really is. However, it can and will one-shot lower-health builds, so it is worth discussing. If you’ve played a fighting game before, it won’t surprise you that you cannot block grabs. This attack will ignore your shield, and heavily punishes sitting behind your block.

Thankfully, it is fairly easy to read. The only trick is differentiating it from Melania’s lunging thrust attack. Both moves start on the ground, where she will rear back before lunging across the arena. For the thrust, she will turn to her right, pulling her sword back. For the grab, Melania will turn slightly left, holding the off-hand she’ll use to grab you at her side. Once you can identify these two attacks they should prove no trouble at all.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p>3. Survive the start of Malenia's second phase by rolling under her
    One new attack in Malenia’s second-phase arsenal is a dive bomb that deals massive damage on impact before unleashing a scarlet rot explosion. The second phase of the fight always starts with this attack, and it can be frustrating to get smashed by this before getting a chance to study the phase. Thankfully, there is a simple trick to dodging it.
    
    All you have to do is roll at and under Melania, just like with Waterfowl Dance. For whatever reason, the secondary explosion seems to consistently catch rolls away from Malenia. Rolling under her seems to effectively dodge both hits, and give you time to back away as the rot flower blooms. If you have any way to deal ranged damage, the lengthy bloom animation is a great time to get some damage in.</p></li></ul>
    <ul><li><p>4. Use weapon skills that knock Malenia down
        Malenia staggers almost as easily as a regular enemy, rewarding your aggression... to a point. She also recovers from staggers quickly and loves to punish you for trying to sneak in an extra hit. However, she is equally easy to knock down or launch, making for larger, safer openings
        
        Certain weapon skills work incredibly well for this. The Blasphemous Blade’s Taker’s Flame skill, Prelate’s Charge, and even a simple Stamp (Uppercut) all serve as effective crowd control. Combine these with a Mimic Tear or other hard-hitting Spirit Ash and you can put Malenia on the backfoot for most of the fight.</p>  </li></ul>
      <ul><li>  <p>5. Use Blood Loss or Frostbite to counteract Malenia's healing
            Malenia’s healing can be frustrating, but there are some ways to counteract it. Of course, “don’t get hit,” is chief among them, but there are more practical methods too. Blood Loss will deal a percentage of Malenia’s health, making it a reliable source of extra damage that can burst through her healing. Weapons like Boody Helice and Rivers of Blood work particularly well.
            
            Frostbite deals less damage upfront but lowers the target’s damage reduction. This will help you deal more consistent damage throughout the fight, making each heal less impactful. The Hoarfrost Stomp skill remains one of the best ways to apply Frostbite even after the recent nerf.

            <div id="txt10"><p>In the days before the Erdtree, the Giants carved out a civilization in the inhospitable mountains to the north, after chasing away the Ice Dragons who had previously ruled it.Here, they worshipped a Fell God and were bound to tend the flame of their god for eternity.

                When Queen Marika the Eternal ushered in her Age of the Erdtree, she launched an attack against the giants, fearing that their fire might burn her Erdtree.
                
                The mighty giants borrowed the power of their Fell God, but were still defeated by Marika and her Golden Order, with Marika personally striking down the Fell God.Only a single Fire Giant remained, and Marika cursed him to forever tend his flame, ensuring it could not harm her Erdtree.During this time, the Fire Giant crafted a leg brace for a wound on his left leg.
                
                After untold ages of tending the flame, the Fire Giant's vigil is interrupted by a Tarnished, seeking to harness the flame to burn the Erdtree. The Fire Giant fights to crush the champion, but the Tarnished repeatedly strikes at the giant's legs, slicing apart his leg brace and causing the giant's left leg to break. In immense pain, the Fire Giant tears off the foot of his broken leg, using it as a sacrifice to unleash the power of the Fell God. Despite being on more even terms, the Fire Giant is eventually felled by the Tarnished.</p></div>
                <div id="hdfg"><u><p>How Defeat Fire Giant?</p></u></div>
               <ul><li> <p>1. Boost your Fire damage negation
                    As the name suggests, the Fire Giant deals a hefty amount of fire damage. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to increase your protection against fire. The easiest item that'll help with this is the Flamedrake Talisman. This is a powerful talisman that increases your fire damage negation. You'll find it in Groveside Cave in Limgrave.

                    There are also stronger variants of this talisman hidden in late-game areas, but collecting them will prove more challenging. The Flamedrake Talisman +1 is found along the edge of the walls in Leyndell, Royal Capital, but you can't collect it until you defeat Morgott, the Omen King. Flamedrake Talisman +2, which offers a total of 20% extra fire damage negation, will drop after killing the Beastmen of Farum Azula in Caelid's Dragonbarrow Cave.
                    
                    If you want to boost your fire damage negation even further, you can also use the Fireproof Dried Liver consumable. This acts similarly to the Flamedrake Talisman, but it is craftable. To make Fireproof Dried Liver, you'll need to get the Armorer's Cookbook from a soldier camp on the ridge above Murkwater Cave, also in Limgrave.
                    
                    To find ways to boost your fire protection even further, take a look at our list of the best armor sets in Elden Ring to find some gear that might boost your fire damage negation</p></li></ul>
                    <ul><li><p>2. Use Torrent to stay agile as you approach
                        As you approach the Fire Giant, it will usually use a large metal plate to send a wave of snow towards your character. This is an incredibly powerful move that could instantly kill you. It's also very hard to dodge on foot, so it's a rough start to the fight.
                        
                        Fortunately, you can use Torrent to dash away from this shockwave. Torrent moves much faster than your character, so you'll be able to use its dash to sprint to the side and avoid taking damage altogether.
                        
                        You could also use the Opaline Bubbletear, a Crystal Tear that provides a one-time bubble shield to protect you from the next hit. Since the Fire Giant's sweep attack can deal a fatal blow in one hit, this Crystal Tear might save you and secure a win against the Fire Giant. You'll get the Opaline Bubbletear from the Erdtree Avatar at the Minor Erdtree in the Weeping Peninsula.
                        
                        </p></li></ul>  
                       <ul><li> <p>3. Attack the left ankle during the first phase
                            After dodging that initial attack, your main focus should be the Fire Giant's left leg. This is the Fire Giant's weakspot in the first phase, so try to land as many hits as possible here.
                            
                            Of course, there are plenty of attacks to avoid while you wail on its poorly ankle. We'll list some of the worst phase one attacks below that you should avoid while attacking the ankle:
                            
                            If you see the Fire Giant lift its leg up, this indicates that it is about to stomp down. Back off a bit until this attack is finished, and then ride back into close-quarters and continue slashing and smacking the left ankle.
                            Sometimes, the Fire Giant may also crouch down and roll around the arena, but this shouldn't prove too troublesome. Instead, just use Torrent to chase it across the open fields and get back into position to keep striking the ankle.
                            If you notice the Fire Giant start to back away, keep an eye on that large metal plate. The giant will reach out in front and drag it back towards your character in a brutal attack that deals massive damage. To avoid this, try dashing out of range before the Fire Giant starts dragging the plate through the snow.
                            If you notice fire starting to rise from the ground, try to get away from the Fire Giant as fast as possible. These will soon erupt into roaring flames that cause a lot of damage if you're caught within the area of effect.
                            After dealing a few thousand points of damage to the ankle, the bandage will tear and give the Fire Giant new fire powers. Fortunately, you can avoid many of these by simply standing by the left ankle like before. This will usually stop the Fire Giant from firing out any fireballs, as it will focus on trying to crush you with physical attacks instead.</p></li></ul> 
                           <ul><li> <p>4. Attack from behind in the second phase
                                In the second phase, the Fire Giant will fall to the ground and rip off its damaged leg to get some more fire powers. Fortunately, you can avoid most of these by simply attacking from behind. Focus on dealing damage to the armored foot to whittle down the Fire Giant's health without getting into danger. The Fire Giant will still use a range of fire attacks and it will also roll to either side more often, so sitting directly behind it is the safest place.
                                
                                While you might notice that hits to the arms deal more damage, we recommend avoiding the front side of the Fire Giant. If you stand in front, the giant will use a range of melee attacks that deal huge chunks of damage. This could end your run in a heartbeat, so we suggest playing it safe and attacking from behind. This will make the Fire Giant's attack pattern a little more limited and the fight much easier.</p></li></ul>
                               <ul><li> <p>5. Trigger the fire orbs to stop their tracking
                                    Throughout the fight, the Fire Giant will occasionally generate two orbs of fire. These will slowly move towards the player, tracking wherever you go. When they get close, they'll start to glow before erupting in a fiery explosion.
                                    
                                    These orbs deal a lot of damage and tend to track for a long time, making them hard to avoid. However, you can remove them from the field altogether by purposefully detonating them. While this may seem counter-intuitive, think of it as a controlled detonation. You know where these fire orbs are and how to remove them from the battlefield, so target them early rather than letting them float around and potentially catch you off guard later in the fight.
                                    
                                    When the Fire Giant summons these orbs, move close to make them glow and then quickly dash away. The orbs will pulse briefly, giving you time to back off to a safe distance before they detonate. Controlling the explosions like this will help you avoid any pesky fire orb sneak attacks later on.

 <div id="maliketh"> <u><p>Maliketh the Black Blade</p></u></div>
 <div id="malikethvideo"><figure><video width="800" poster="./pics2]/maliketh.jpeg" controls autoplay><source src="./videos/SaveTube.io-Maliketh The Black Blade Cutscene (One of the coolest Bosses in Elden Ring).mp4"></video></figure></div>
 <div id="txt11"><p>Maliketh is the loyal Shadowbound Beast and half-brother of Queen Marika the Eternal, an Empyrean of Numen descent, who would become the vessel of the Elden Ring.

    Maliketh fought and defeated the Gloam-Eyed Queen, the leader of the Godskin Apostles. On Marika's orders, Maliketh sealed away the Rune of Death, binding it within his blade, causing the true power of the god-slaying black flame to be lost.
    
    When the Rune of Death was plucked from the Elden Ring, and confined,the Golden Order was created, with Queen Marika as its one true god. Marika's offspring were granted a form of immortality owing to the removal of their fated deaths from the Elden Ring, however there was not one Demigod who did not fear Maliketh and his blade imbued with death. He was a beast of such terrifying ferocity that his name came to mean "Death of the Demigods". He also led the Black Blade Kindred, living gargoyles who wielded weapons held together by blackened corpse wax
    
    During the Golden Age of the Erdtree, a fragment of the Rune of Death was stolen from Maliketh. The perpetrator was Ranni the Witch, who used it to forge godslaying black knives, which were wielded by the Black Knife Assassins during the assassination of Godwyn the Golden on the Night of Black Knives. Maliketh responded by binding his blade- and the Rune of Death sealed within- into his own flesh, to prevent death from ever being stolen again. Later, the Rune of Death sprouted from Godwyn's corpse and began to spread through the Lands Between in the form of Deathroot. Maliketh, under the name Gurranq, resolved to track down and devour the Deathroot, eventually gaining an insatiable hunger for it.
    
    Maliketh, now Gurranq, eventually came into contact with D, Hunter of the Dead. D entered Gurranq's service and assisted him in weeding Deathroot, the source of Those Who Live in Death. D would later find a Tarnished, who agreed to take his place in weeding Deathroot.
    
    The Tarnished encounters Gurranq in the Bestial Sanctum in Caelid. The beast, dressed in the robes of a clergyman, gives them an eye which trembles in the presence of Deathroot, and instructs them to bring him any Deathroot they find in return for bestial incantations. Despite consuming all the Deathroot the Tarnished could bring him, Gurranq is not sated, yet he realises that he has done all he can for the land and departs, with his hunger as his only companion.
    
    When the Tarnished arrives at the foot of the Erdtree, they find the entrance obstructed by thorns. To remove the thorns, the Tarnished and their companion, Melina, set the Erdtree ablaze at the Giant's Forge. After doing so, the Tarnished finds themselves in Crumbling Farum Azula, an ancient city in the sky, where they seek the Rune of Death. The Tarnished finally comes upon Gurranq, who attempts to stop them from stealing the Rune of Death from him. Despite his best efforts, Gurranq struggles to overcome the Tarnished. As a last resort, he unbinds his death-imbued blade from his flesh and reveals his true identity to the Tarnished. Nevertheless, Maliketh falls to the Tarnished, and with his dying breath cries out to Marika for forgiveness. The Rune of Death is unbound, and enshrouds the Lands Between. However, this allows the impenetrable thorns to finally burn away allowing the Tarnished to finally gain access to the Erdtree.</p></div>
   <div id="hdmk"><u><p>How Defeat Maliketh?</p></u></div>
   <ul><li><p>1. Stay Behind the Beast Clergyman
    The Beast Clergyman fights fast and aggressive, with quick projectiles and diving melee attacks. He will charge you earlier than most bosses, making it tricky to even get Spirit Ashes off. However, many of the Beast Clergyman’s attacks have long animations that keep him swinging in a single direction.

If you can roll through the first swing and get behind him, you can get a lot of damage off. Any Spirit Ash summon that can hold his attention will be a big help. The Mimic Tear is always a top option, but anything that can survive his onslaught will do. I recommend sticking to single-entity summons though, as group summons like Giant Rats or Greatshield Soldiers may pull his aggro back towards you
   </p></li></ul>
  <ul><li> <p>2. Watch for ground effects in the Clergyman phase
    When the Beast Clergyman rears back for a big wind-up, you need to run away from him. He will soon slam down, breaking the ground around him in a manner similar to Godrick’s “Kneel!” attack. You will see broken ground spiral out all around him, but the attack isn’t over.
    
    A second later, the ground will shatter and launch rocks into the air, dealing more damage. These rocks will hover for a moment before dropping down, dealing damage again. Keep track of where the ground is broken, and you can avoid massive damage.</p> </li></ul>
   <ul><li> <p>3. Roll through attacks, not away from them
        In both phases of this fight, your best bet is often to roll through attacks rather than away from them. We’ve already covered the merits of getting behind the Beast Clergyman, but Maliketh’s attacks really encourage this. He has several quick combos that can easily catch you coming out of a roll unless you go straight through the attack to slide behind him.
        
        This applies to his most dangerous AoE attack too. Maliketh will often jump from a pillar and slam his sword down, creating a swirl of death magic around the sword. If you see this attack coming, try to roll under and past him.</p></li></ul>
       <ul><li><p>4. Use the Crimsonburst Crystal Tear to counter damage over time
            At some point, Maliketh is going to hit you. If you aren’t careful, the damage over time effect of the Black Blade will doom you. We recommend mixing the Crimsonburst Crystal Tear into your Flask of Wondrous Physick to counteract the damage over time. The healing can’t quite keep up with the damage over time effect, but it can be enough to save your life.</p></li></ul> 
           <ul><li> <p>5. Parry Maliketh with the Blasphemous Claw
                If you completed Knight Bernahl’s questline and repelled his invasion in Crumbling Farum Azula, you will have the Blasphemous Claw in your inventory. This special item has one purpose; parrying Maliketh’s Black Blad attacks. You can equip the Blasphemous Claw to either your consumable bar or pouch.

While the Claw is equipped, Maliketh’s most dangerous attacks will generate a gold-tinge around his sword. Activate the Blasphemous Claw to parry these attacks. The timing is tight, but if you’ve practiced parrying against other enemies you will quickly get the hang of it. If you do, you can basically trivialize the Maliketh phase of this fight.

        <div id="txt12"><p>Gideon Ofnir is the Tarnished leader of Roundtable Hold and the adoptive father of Nepheli Loux. Called to the Lands Between by the guidance of Grace, Gideon wishes to become Elden Lord. To this end he accumulates information on the Shardbearers, employing a network of spies to aid in his hunt for knowledge. Initially, he is apprehensive of the Tarnished, but after they have claimed a Great Rune he becomes willing to share his knowledge of the remaining shardbearers.

            In the past, Gideon took in Nepheli Loux after she lost sight of the guidance of Grace, taking advantage of her youthful credulity.[4] He promised her that he would not allow the downtrodden to be cheated any longer if he became Elden Lord. He also became acquainted with Preceptor Seluvis and Dolores the Sleeping Arrow, although he and Seluvis would go their separate ways because of Dolores.
            
            At some point, Gideon engaged in a long exchange with the Two Fingers, and in doing so learned that everything- including the Erdtree and the Two Fingers themselves- had been broken. He also glimpsed into the will of Queen Marika the Eternal, shuddering in fear at an end that should not be. He concluded from this that the queen wished for the Tarnished to struggle eternally.
            
            Although Gideon had amassed knowledge on many of the shardbearers, he had not ascertained the whereabouts of four demigods: Ranni the Witch; Mohg, Lord of Blood; Malenia, Blade of Miquella; and Miquella of the Haligtree. In his search for the latter, he sends his men to ransack the Village of the Albinaurics in Liurnia of the Lakes, knowing that the Albinaurics possess half of a secret medallion that would open the path to the Haligtree. The slaughter of the Albinaurics causes Nepheli to lose faith in him, which causes him to abandon her. He also sought Latenna, an Albinauric woman with knowledge of the location of the other half of the medallion. If the Tarnished claims one half of the medallion, Gideon's underling Ensha will ambush them in Roundtable Hold, apparently of his own volition. After Ensha is defeated, Gideon compensates the Tarnished by sharing the possible whereabouts of the medallion's other half.
            
            After the Tarnished burns the Erdtree and unseals the Rune of Death, Gideon makes his way to Leyndell, Ashen Capital, where he confronts the Tarnished in the Erdtree Sanctuary. Upon his defeat, he warned them that a Tarnished could not become a Lord, and that a man cannot kill a god.</p></div>

Godfrey is2. Watch for ground effects in the Clergyman phase
When the Beast Clergyman rears back for a big wind-up, you need to run away from him. He will soon slam down, breaking the ground around him in a manner similar to Godrick’s “Kneel!” attack. You will see broken ground spiral out all around him, but the attack isn’t over.

A second later, the ground will shatter and launch rocks into the air, dealing more damage. These rocks will hover for a moment before dropping down, dealing damage again. Keep track of where the ground is broken, and you can avoid massive damage. regarded as the first Elden Lord of the Golden Order,and the former consort of Queen Marika the Eternal. Godfrey was once a ferocious warrior, but when he vowed to become a lord he took upon his back the lion Serosh, the Lord of Beasts,to suppress his ceaseless lust for battle.

On Marika's orders, Godfrey led the War Against the Giants,putting the Giants to the sword and confining their flame upon the Mountaintops of the Giants. This war marked the birth of the Erdtree, an epoch which would be ruled over by Queen Marika and her Elden Lord.

Godfrey and his offspring with Queen Marika became the first Demigods, regarded as the Golden Lineage.Serosh's image became an emblem of the Golden Lineage,acting as a counselor and guide for them. Notable members of the Golden Lineage include Godwyn the Golden; the Omen twins Morgott and Mohg; and the feeble Godrick, the last of the Golden Lineage.

Before it came to be an embodiment of Order, everything was in opposition to the Erdtree.This age began amidst conflict, and Godfrey was regarded as the Lord of the Battlefield.He wielded a great double-headed axe in battle, a weapon which symbolised the warrior's vow to conduct himself as a lord and which would later become a symbol of the Golden Lineage. Axe ornamentation would also become symbolic of the knight Ordovis, who commanded the Crucible Knights under Godfrey's command.

The Long March
As the Lord of the Battlefield, Godfrey fought in many battles. During the siege of Castle Morne, Godfrey bested a lone hero who fought for vengeance. On top of leading the war against the Giants, he faced the Storm Lord alone. However, when his last enemy fell, it is said that the hue of Godfrey's eyes faded. At the end of his campaign, although his golden armies were unvanquished and unbowed, he found his Grace lost, tattered and faded. He and his warriors were addressed by Queen Marika, who informed them that she had divested them of their Grace. She commanded them to leave the Lands Between, to wage war in a land afar, where they would live and die.Thus, Godfrey and his kinfolk became the first Tarnished, and left the Lands Between together on a pilgrimage known as the Long March, at the end of which Godfrey divested himself of kingship and became a simple warrior once more.

Godfrey became a chieftain of the Badlands, under the name of Hoarah Loux. Although the head of his axe had been broken in a battle fought during the Long March, his loyal warriors honored him by wielding axes of their own, and they became the weapon of choice for Badlands chieftains.

Return to the Lands Between
At some point, Hoarah Loux died. However, when the Elden Ring was shattered following the death of Godwyn the Golden, another member of the Golden Lineage, the Tarnished who had died outside the Lands Between were returned to life by the call of their long-lost Grace. This fulfilled a promise Marika had made before Godfrey and his men had departed the Lands Between: that after their deaths they would regain what she had claimed from them, before returning to the Lands Between to wage war and brandish the Elden Ring. The Tarnished, who had grown strong in the face of death, crossed the fog and returned to the Lands Between, to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord.

Godfrey was among those who made their way back to the Lands Between. After the Tarnished has claimed the Great Runes, burned the Erdtree, and unbound the Rune of Death,they return to the city of Leyndell and approach the Erdtree. At the Elden Throne they find Godfrey, Serosh at his back, mourning the death of Morgott, whom the Tarnished had previously slain.Godfrey rises to his feet and addresses the Tarnished. He acknowledges their effort, however he declares his intention to be once again granted audience.The two Tarnished do battle, and Godfrey finds himself overpowered. The former Elden Lord grabs the head of Serosh, thanks him for his service, and then tears him from his back. Drenched in the blood of his loyal regent, Godfrey resumes the fight, now as Hoarah Loux. Nevertheless, the Tarnished defeats Godfrey, who declares that their strength befits a crown.With Godfrey dead, the Tarnished finally gains entry to the Erdtree, to seek audience with Queen Marika.

  <div id="hdgf"><u><p><strong>How Defeat Godfrey?</strong></p></u></div>
 <ul><li> <p>1. Use heavy armor
    Both Godfrey and Hoarah Loux use a range of physical strike attacks, meaning you should bring the heaviest armor you own. With a strong defence, you'll be able to shake off any of their attacks and easily overcome this challenge.
    
    Many of the options in our list of the best armor sets in Elden Ring will suit you well here. In the video above, Ollie uses Lionel's set, but Radahn's armor is also worth considering if you missed out on finding Lionel's armor earlier in the game.</p></li></ul>
   <ul><li> <p>2. Boost your physical damage negation
        While the armor sets above will certainly help, there's no need to stop there. You can use a range of items to boost your physical damage negation, making the Godfrey/Hoarah Loux boss fight a walk in the park.
        
        If you're looking for an item to equip, our list of the best talismans in Elden Ring explains where to find the Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman. This greatly boosts your physical damage negation, but you can push it even further. If you visit Boilprawn Shack in Liurnia, you can buy a Boiled Prawn item from Blackguard Big Boggart.
        
        Using these items will make your physical defence even better, ensuring that any hits from Godfrey/Hoarah Loux inflict much less damage than normal.</p></li></ul>
     <ul><li> <p>3. Summon spirits for a helping hand
            Godfrey and Hoarah Loux are both incredibly fast bosses, performing relentless combos like the best fighting game characters you could imagine. These attacks might prove tricky to dodge consistently, so we suggest summoning spirit ashes to help. They will hold Godfrey's aggression, allowing you to get in some easy hits while he tries to chase your summons.</p></li>
        </ul>
          <ul><li> <p>4. Use heavy attacks to stagger
                When you see an opening to attack between attacks from either boss, try using heavy attacks to break his poise. Godfrey and Hoarah Loux are surprisingly easy to stagger with heavy attacks, so you should be able to perform a few visceral attacks throughout the fight.

When you stagger Godfrey or Hoarah Loux, move around to the front and use a light attack to trigger a visceral. This will deal a huge chunk of damage without putting you in any danger, offering a welcome respite and giving you a great advantage in this fight.
            </p></li></ul> 
          <ul><li> <p>5. Take your time and learn their combos
             <div id="hdgf_2"> <u><p>Godfrey, the first Elden Lord (phase 1)</p></u></div> 
                <ul><li><strong>Melee attacks:</strong>Godfrey uses a mix of moves with his axe. These include an uppercut, swings from either side, and a twirl over his head leading into a slam. He also occasionally lifts his leg before stomping down. You can roll to dodge all of these as they land, but you'll need to pay attention so that you can nail the timing.</li></ul>
                <ul><li><strong>Fissure:</strong> Godfrey will slam his axe into the ground and cause a fissure to open. When he pulls his axe up, it will cause the fissure to explode. Get some distance and wait for the explosion before getting close to attack again.</li></ul>
                <ul><li><strong>Shockwave:</strong> Godfrey will lift his leg for an extended period of time before slamming it down into the ground. This will send a shockwave throughout the arena. You can roll to dodge this, but the timing is tricky. Fortunately, Godfrey doesn't seem to use this move if you stay nearby.</li></ul>
                    <div id="hdgf_3"> <u><p>Hoarah Loux, Warrior (phase 2)</p></u></div>
                 <ul><li><strong>Melee attacks:</strong> Hoarah Loux ditches Godfrey's axe, but he still uses a range of melee attacks chained together. Again, these combos are unpredictable, so watch the attacks and learn when to dodge for your weight class.</li></ul>
                <ul><li><strong>Grapple:</strong> The key in this phase is to avoid any melee attacks that could lead into a grapple, as these lock you into an animation that deals massive damage. The most common grapple attack that Hoarah Loux uses involves reaching back with his right arm before lunging forward to grab you. However, he does also seem to grapple after using the cross swipe melee attack, in which he rushes towards you while crossing his arms in an X shape. Avoid these by dodging away from Hoarah Loux as the strike is about to connect.</li></ul>
                <ul><li><strong>Ground pound:</strong> Hoarah Loux lifts his leg for an extended period of time, similar to Godfrey's shockwave move. However, Hoarah Loux will perform a slightly different move, slamming into the ground with his fists. He will then slam into the ground again, sending out two shockwaves in total. Stay far away from Hoarah Loux and prepare to roll when the shockwaves approach.</li></ul><hr>

               <div id="txt14"> <p>Liurnian Wars and Marriage to Queen Rennala
                    Radagon first rose to prominence during the Liurnian Wars, when he joined the heroes' ranks.A great champion with flowing red locks, he arrived in Liurnia at the head of a golden host, where he met Queen Rennala in battle.Although two wars would be fought between them, the First Liurnian War,and the Second, no victor would emerge from either Radagon eventually repented his territorial aggressions by cleansing himself with Celestial Dew, and swore his love to Rennala. He became husband to the Carian Queen,wedding her at the Church of Vows. Rennala bequeathed him a greatsword, bestowed by Carian queen upon her spouse to honor long-standing tradition.After entering into marriage with Rennala and joining the Carian line, he ordered the Carian magic preceptors to don masks of confidence, to make it clear that all of their matters were to be kept strictly private.
                    
                    Radagon and Rennala had three children: Radahn, Rykard and Ranni.While husband to Rennala, Radagon studied glintstone sorcery taught at the Academy of Raya Lucaria.
                    
                    After Godfrey, the First Elden Lord was stripped of grace and hounded from the Lands Between, Radagon returned to the capital where he went on to marry Queen Marika and become her King Consort and second Elden Lord.Before leaving Rennala, Radagon gifted her an amber egg His departure left her heartbroken, and eventually led to her being deposed by the academy and imprisoned in the Grand Library. His three children from the previous marriage would be raised to demigod status as stepchildren of Queen Marika.
                    
                    Marriage to Queen Marika
                    A sculptor from Leyndell was commissioned to create a statue of Radagon.In doing so, he discovered a secret - that Radagon is Marika. This secret was hidden within the statue, and is revealed by casting Law of Regression in front of it, causing the statue's form to change from Radagon to Marika.
                    
                    Radagon and Marika had a twin daughter and son: Malenia and Miquella. As they were born of a single god, they were both Empyreans, but were born afflicted: Malenia with rotting sickness and Miquella with eternal childhood.
                    
                    While married to Marika, Radagon studied incantations. He is heavily associated with Golden Order Fundamentalism, a branch of the Golden Order said to be scholarship in all but name, which incorporates incantations that rely on a combination of faith and intelligence. His son Miquella followed in his fundamentalist footsteps, and created several incantations as gifts for his father.Radagon would return the favor with his own gift of gratitude to young Miquella, however Miquella later abandoned Fundamentalism, realising that it could do nothing to treat Malenia's Rot.
                    
                    The Shattering
                    Radagon repairing the Elden Ring
                   
                    
                    Following the Night of Black Knives, Marika shattered the Elden Ring, breaking the Golden Order. Radagon, on the other hand, remained loyal to the Golden Order, and attempted to repair the Elden Ring with the same hammer used to shatter it. As punishment, Marika was imprisoned inside the Erdtree. While Radagon had opposed Marika's treachery, he would share Marika's sentence, as the two were now bound in a single body.
                    
                    When a Tarnished sets fire to the Erdtree in order to burn away the wall of thorns denying their entry, they encounter the imprisoned Marika. Suddenly released from her bonds, her hair immediately turns red as Radagon assumes control of their shared body and wields Marika's hammer to fight the Tarnished. Radagon is unable to defeat them, however, and falls at their hands, his body subsumed by the Elden Beast to be transformed into a large sword as it emerges to be the Tarnished champion's final challenger.</p></div>
                   <div id="hdrd"> <p>How Defeat Radagon?</p></div>
                     <ul><li><p>1. Jump over Radagon’s ground slam effects
                        Radagon’s various holy ground slams track the player extremely well and often involve secondary explosions that make it very tricky to dodge them by rolling. It is possible to roll through these with impeccable timing and direction, but there is an easier method. You can jump over these blasts of Holy damage to avoid them entirely. This still requires some timing, but the window to jump over these attacks is much more generous than the window to roll through them</p> </li></ul>  
                       <ul><li> <p>2. Use fire damage and Blackflame
                            Radagon is surprisingly weak to fire damage, and any flame-based attacks, skills, and spells can very quickly dispatch him. Popular weapons like Blasphemous Blade and the Sword of Night and Flame work great for this, as do fire Incantations and Sorceries. Use any of these to deal huge chunks of damage to Radagon.

Black Flame skills and spells work particularly well, dealing high damage upfront before dealing even more damage over time. The Black Flame incantation lets you apply this from range, while non-elemental melee weapon users can use Black Flame Blade to temporarily apply Black Flame effects to their weapon. Black Flame Blade requires only 17 Faith, so a minor respec may be worthwhile if you’re struggling.
                        </p></li></ul>
                       <ul><li> <p>3. Avoid Blood Loss weapons
                            On the flipside, Radagon is extremely resistant to Holy damage and outright immune to Blood Loss. Blood Loss is a very popular build strategy, but you will gain nothing from it here. If you’ve been using katanas or other Blood Loss scaling weapons throughout the game, you may find you have enough damage to get by without it.</p></li></ul>
                           <ul><li> <p>4. Break Radagon’s Poise with jump attacks and guard counters.
                                Like many humanoid bosses in Elden Ring, Radagon’s Poise, the stat that determines when an enemy’s stance breaks for a critical opening, is a bit low. Heavy weapon wielders and shield users can take advantage of this to deal tons of damage quickly. Jumping attacks are one of the best ways to break an enemy's poise, and work particularly well with heavy, strength-based weapons. Guard Counters also do the trick, and may work better for faster, lighter weapons. Use the Claw Talisman for jump attacks or the Curved Sword Talisman for Guard Counters to drop Radagon even faster.</p></li></ul><hr>  
                               <div id="elden"><u><p><strong>Elden Beast</strong></p></u></div>

                               <div id="txt15"> <p>Long ago, the Greater Will sent a golden star bearing a beast into the Lands Between, which would later became the Elden Ring. It was the vassal beast of the Greater Will and the living incarnation of the concept of Order. Marika, a Numen Empyrean, would became a goddess and the vessel of the Elden Ring and would establish the Golden Order and rule over the Lands Between as the one true god.However, Marika would eventually shatter the Elden Ring, leading to her imprisonment inside the Erdtree.

                                    After untold hardships, the Tarnished fights their way inside the Erdtree where they find the shackled Marika, and face Radagon, Marika's male "other self" and the reigning Elden Lord, the two of them sharing the same body. After his defeat, the Elden Beast emerges from Radagon, transforming Radagon's defeated body into a large sword, and faces the Tarnished.
                                    
                                    The Tarnished manages to triumph, and with the Elden Beast defeated, they were free to usher in a new age of their choosing.</p></div>
                                    <div id="hde"> <u><p><strong>How Defeat Elden Beast?</strong></p></u></div>
               <ul><li> <p>1. Jump over the closing rings
                    A few times during the fight, the Elden Beast will fly up into the stars above your head, and release a spell on the floor while you’re distracted. Look down, and you’ll notice one or more golden rings closing in on you as the floor begins to shine and crack in a circle. You need to get out of this circle before it explodes, dealing a large amount of Holy damage.
                    
                    Your first instinct might be to roll through the enclosing rings, but dodging this spell is actually even simpler than that. All you need to do is run away from the center and jump over the rings to avoid them. Early in the fight, there will only be one ring, while later instances of the spell will have three. If you’re quick on your feet, you can easily avoid taking any damage from this spell.</p></li></ul>
                   <ul><li><p>2. Roll through Elden Stars, then run
                        The Elden Stars spell is the toughest part of this fight. With this ability, the Elden Beast fires a golden projectile that tracks its target around the arena, constantly firing off small golden stars. While a single star won’t do much damage, a stream of them can quickly overwhelm and kill you. Eventually, the main projectile explodes for another burst of damage. It is nearly impossible to avoid all damage from this spell, but you can at least avoid death.

You can outrun Elden Stars for a bit, but it will eventually catch up. When it does, roll straight at it and then keep running in that direction. It takes a moment for the Elden Stars to pivot and keep following you. Any distance you put between you and the Elden Stars during that brief window can buy you time to heal, or prep for another dodge. You’re probably still going to get hit by a couple of stars, but you can avoid getting stuck directly under the center star this way.
                    </p> </li></ul> 
                    <ul><li><p>3. Keep moving towards the Elden Beast
                        The Elden Beast is highly mobile despite its size, and the arena is enormous. Unfortunately for melee builds, that means you’re going to spend a lot of time chasing the Beast around. There’s really no way around this, so just keep moving towards the Elden Beast at all times. Remember your ABCs; Always Be Closing. Roll towards the Beast to dodge projectiles, run towards it when avoiding Elden Stars or the star rain attack, and try to roll in when it swipes with its sword. You’re only going to get damage in if you are constantly closing the gap.</p></li></ul> 
                      <ul><li>  <p>4. Avoid status effects and Holy damage
                            Like Radagon, the Elden Beast has high Holy resistance, as well as immunity to the Blood Loss status. However, the Elden Beast is also immune to every other status effect in Elden Ring. While Scarlet Rot, Poison, and Frostbite are often supplemental, many builds rely heavily on Blood Loss for their damage. If you’re using Katanas or a weapon with the Blood affinity, you may need to change up your build. Unlike Radagon, the Elden Beast has no particular weaknesses, so any weapons without Holy damage and status effects will perform about the same.</p></li></ul>
                            <ul><li><p>5. Raise your Holy resistance
                                The Elden Beast deals loads of Holy damage with its various spells and abilities, so Holy resistance goes a long way. This is especially true when it comes to Elden Stars, which is bound to hit you a few times per fight without some luck. The Divine Fortification Incantation requires only 10 Faith, so most builds can equip a seal and activate it. The Holyproof Dried Liver consumable also helps, as does the Haligdrake Talisman +2, found near the Giant Crow farming spot in Mohgwyn Palace.
                                
                                </p></li></ul>
